    <p>Fjords are long, narrow inlets of the sea that are surrounded by steep cliffs or mountains, formed by the deep erosion of glaciers over thousands of years. These stunning natural formations are most commonly found in countries like Norway, New Zealand, and parts of Canada, where glaciers once covered large areas.</p>

    <p>Light is a form of energy that makes it possible for us to see the world around us. It travels in waves and can come from natural sources like the sun or from man-made sources like bulbs and LEDs. Light helps plants grow, keeps us warm, and allows us to work, read, and move safely at night. It also plays an important role in science, technology, and communication, making it one of the most essential parts of our daily lives.</p>

    <p>Mountains are large, elevated landforms that rise prominently above their surroundings. They are formed through natural processes like the movement of tectonic plates or volcanic activity. Mountains are often covered with forests, snow, or rocky terrain and are home to many plants and animals. They provide water sources, influence weather patterns, and offer beautiful landscapes for hiking, climbing, and exploring. Mountains are not only important for nature but also hold cultural and spiritual significance in many parts of the world.
